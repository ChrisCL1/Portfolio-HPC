    "Overallocation in Python lists refers to the strategy where Python pre-allocates more memory than is currently needed for a list's elements. This is done to optimize append operations by minimizing the number of times the list needs to reallocate memory as it grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you append to a list in Python, it doesn't necessarily allocate space for just one additional element. Instead, it allocates room for a number of elements in advance. The exact algorithm for this growth strategy is an implementation detail and may vary, but the idea is to balance memory usage with the need for speed of append operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the list operations you provided, list.append(1) has consistently low times regardless of the list size. This demonstrates overallocation at work: most of the time, appending doesn't require a memory reallocation because there's already space reserved for new elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, operations like list.insert(0, 1) show a linear increase in time as the list size grows, because inserting at the beginning of a list forces all the subsequent elements to move one space in memory, which is costly. This operation does not benefit from overallocation because it doesn’t involve simply adding an element at the end but rather reorganizing the existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overallocation mechanism makes appending to lists in Python a very efficient operation (O(1) amortized time complexity), which is why appending to lists can be done quickly even as the list grows in size. However, this also means that a list might use more memory than the exact number of elements it contains at any given time."
